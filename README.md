# Project-Food-Website
A french gastronomic recipe website made for a school project
In the recipe-website.zip, there is no img folder. Take the folder from img-1.zip and the image in it and put that in the main folder (recipe-website.zip) take the image from img-2 and put it in the first img folder and do the same with img-3.
The folder was too big so I had to put them in three different folder.
